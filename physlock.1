.TH PHYSLOCK 1 physlock\-VERSION
.SH NAME
physlock \- lock all consoles / virtual terminals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B physlock
.RB [ \-dhLlsv ]
.RB [ \-u
.IR USER ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
physlock is an alternative to vlock, it is equivalent to `vlock \-an'. It is
written because vlock blocks some linux kernel mechanisms like hibernate and
suspend and can therefore only be used with some limitations.
.P
physlock is designed to be lightweight, but highly depends on the kernels ioctl
API.
.P
The behaviour of physlock is completely controlled via command-line arguments,
it does not rely on environment variables.
It always allows unlocking as root and as a specified user. If no username is
given on the command line, then physlock uses the name of the calling user.
.SH OPTIONS

use in suspend/hibernate scripts.

.TP
.B \-l
Only lock console switching and exit.
.TP

locked.
